# Ansible Collection

My personal Ansible automation collection.

This repository contains various automation playbooks and roles designed to simplify and streamline application deployments and management across different environments. I have a another large private repo with much more and I'll add other projects once I scrub them.

## Ansible Projects

### AWS
- **HTMX on AWS**: [aws-ec2-htmx](https://github.com/mkonji008/ansible-collection/tree/aws-ec2-htmx) - Deploy a minimal HTMX container app on AWS EC2 with NGINX and Certbot SSL.
