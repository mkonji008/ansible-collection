# Ansible Collection

A personal collection of Ansible playbooks for configuration management and deployments across different environments. This repository includes a variety of projects, and I plan to add more as I refine and organize content from a larger private repository.

## Ansible Projects

### AWS

  *HTMX on AWS EC2*
  - Deploys a minimal HTMX container app on AWS EC2, featuring NGINX and Certbot for SSL certification.

### GCP

  *HUGO + HTMX on GKE in GCP*
  - Sets up a Hugo static site with HTMX integration for dynamic elements, deployed on a GKE cluster in GCP.
